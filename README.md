# 3I-PhaseMap-ImagingSuite
# 3I–PhaseMap–ImagingSuite

A modular imaging pipeline for reconstructing phase-coherent structures in quantum-filtered cometary data.

Anchored by the 3I/Atlas emission corridor observation, this framework integrates:
- Spatial and temporal coherence mapping
- Physics-informed constraints and scattering models
- Photon-counting statistics and compressed sensing
- Machine learning for feature detection and corridor persistence

Designed for adaptability, transparency, and cross-instrument validation, this suite invites collaborative refinement and symbolic resonance. If raw photon-counting frames and system calibrations (PSF/MTF, flats/darks) are available, we welcome testing and dialogue to confirm phase persistence and distinguish coherent astronomical features from instrumental artifacts.

Let’s explore this together.
