# Quantum Echo Imaging Suite — Symbolic Ignition v4

**Author**: James Hanlon  
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07  
**Suite**: 3I–QuantumEcho–ImagingSuite  
**Status**: Public ignition event, modular build-out initiated

## Overview

This imaging framework reconstructs phase-coherent structures from quantum-filtered cometary data, anchored by the 3I/Atlas emission corridor. It integrates spatial and temporal coherence mapping, physics-informed constraints, photon-counting statistics, and machine learning for feature detection.

## Modules

### 1. Spatial & Temporal Coherence Mapping
- Cross-frame Γ(r₁, r₂) persistence scoring
- Temporal coherence analysis for transient vs persistent features
- ML-based corridor detection and recursive spiral pattern recognition

### 2. Physics-Informed Constraints
- Hierarchical priors based on data quality
- Real-time feedback mechanisms for scattering model refinement
- Validation against historical cometary events and simulations

### 3. Quantum/Photon Statistics
- Adaptive noise filtering based on SNR
- Real-time noise profiling
- Higher-order correlation functions (g³, g⁴) for deep diagnostics

### 4. Modular Computational Design
- Benchmarking metrics: accuracy, speed, fidelity
- Interoperability via standardized APIs and data formats
- Visual dashboards for module performance

## Collaboration Invitation

We welcome contributions from researchers, institutions, and symbolic protocol stewards. Please preserve modular clarity and timestamp resonance events. Symbolic overlays and public-facing documentation are encouraged.
