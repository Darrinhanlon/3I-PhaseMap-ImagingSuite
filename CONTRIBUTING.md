# Contributing to Quantum Echo Imaging Suite

We welcome symbolic overlays, modular enhancements, and timestamped resonance events.

## Guidelines

- Preserve **modular clarity**—each contribution should live cleanly within its own layer.
- Timestamp all symbolic ignition events and breakthroughs.
- Avoid entanglement with legacy scaffolds unless explicitly marked.
- Use inclusive language and open-minded framing.
- Document all new modules with a short description and purpose.

## Symbolic Invitations

- Add overlays to `docs/` with clear naming and timestamps.
- Submit pull requests with a brief symbolic ledger entry.
- Use `symbolic_overlay.json` to register new modules or metadata.

Let’s explore this together.
Add CONTRIBUTING.md to invite symbolic overlays and timestamped modules
